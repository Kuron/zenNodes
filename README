A Javascript implementation of Zen Coding that generates DOM nodes.

A few weeks back, I wanted to quickly generate a DOM structure based on a compact string as a template for my views rather than storing them in script tags, but I wasn't able to get a hold on how I wanted to do it at the time. More recently, I remembered about reading Zen Coding awhile ago and saw that there isn't a Javascript implementation of it, so I started this project. This project also helped me get into the mindset of writing (my first) parsers as well, so it was a nice learning experience.

Notes
* I added a backreference (like regex) for groups, but its very limited in where it can be used
* I haven't tested zenNodes extensively yet, so there may still be some obvious problems or some differences from Zen Coding at the moment

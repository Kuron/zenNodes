A Javascript implementation of Zen Coding that generates DOM nodes.

A few weeks back, I wanted to quickly generate a DOM structure based on a compact string as a template for my views rather than storing them in script tags, but I wasn't able to get a hold on how I wanted to do it at the time. More recently, I remembered about reading Zen Coding awhile ago and saw that there isn't a Javascript implementation of it, so I started this project.

This project has helped me get into the mindset of writing my first parser as well, so it was a good learning experience.

Credits goes to Zen Coding author(s) for the original design.
